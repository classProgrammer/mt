\section{Conclusion}
Table \ref{tab:entity_extraction_eval} ranks the frameworks based on their 
entity extracton capabilities.
The best person and date entities are present at Dialogflow.
The best date-span entity is the time entity of Duckling 
and the date entity of Watson Assistant which reached the same f-score.
The best combined date and date-span extractor is Duckling.
The best overal entity extraction performance is achieved by Rasa through 
a combination of Duckling and Spacy followed closely by Dialogflow.
From the entity extraction capabilities alone either Rasa or 
Dialogflow need to be recommended.
The other frameworks performed a lot worse in the entity extraction 
department.
The intent classification is dominated by Watson and Dialogflow 
since they were able to classify all test cases correctly.
LUIS failed most of the intent detection tests and can't be 
recommended.
Dialogflow wins the average confidence score comparison in front of Watson 
shown in Table \ref{tab:intent_classification_result}.
The other two technologies were unable to keep up.
This is an indication that Rasa and LUIS need more training date to 
reach the same performance level as Dialogflow and Watson.
From the numeric values based on the entity extraction and intent recognition 
the recommended technology is Dialogflow.
Rasa and Watson are in the middle and can be recommended too.
LUIS can't be recommended because of the horrible performance in 
the intent classification tests.





\section{Outlook}
In \citet{singhbuilding} a chatbot is used for a banking system which is a possible use case for the 3-Banken-IT.

A common use case for chatbots are FAQs(\citet{evaluateChatbotsShawar2007, buiildChatbotsPython, huang2007extracting, GO2019304}) and is another possible use case for most companies.


Like \citet{GO2019304} there are multiple ways to make users believe that they are talking to a bot.
For an actual chatbot there needs to be decided if the users should know that they are talking to a bot or not.
If they believe to talk to a bot they expect less but the conversation is generally treated more machiene like \cite{GO2019304}.
When users assume to talk to a human the conversation is judged as more natural but if the bot performs bad 
the experience is also evaluated as more negative \cite{GO2019304}.
Like \citet{shawar2007chatbots} said, a chatbot should not imitate humans they should be used to 
reduce their workload and help them.

The best source for conversational data is real-life conversations of real customers with the expert to get the most realistic training data possible \cite{singhbuilding}.
