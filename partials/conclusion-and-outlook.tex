\section{Outlook}
In \citet{singhbuilding} a chatbot is used for a banking system which is a possible use case for the 3-Banken-IT.

A common use case for chatbots are FAQs(\citet{evaluateChatbotsShawar2007, buiildChatbotsPython, huang2007extracting, GO2019304}) and is another possible use case for most companies.


Like \citet{GO2019304} there are multiple ways to make users believe that they are talking to a bot.
For an actual chatbot there needs to be decided if the users should know that they are talking to a bot or not.
If they believe to talk to a bot they expect less but the conversation is generally treated more machiene like \cite{GO2019304}.
When users assume to talk to a human the conversation is judged as more natural but if the bot performs bad 
the experience is also evaluated as more negative \cite{GO2019304}.
Like \citet{shawar2007chatbots} said, a chatbot should not imitate humans they should be used to 
reduce their workload and help them.
