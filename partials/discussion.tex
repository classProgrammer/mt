The price comparison of Section \ref{sec:pricing} shows that all 
tested frameworks can be used for free.
Dialogflow is better when there is a lot of users with little chatbot interaction.
Watson offers a better value when the users interact a lot with the bot.
With Rasa the costs depend on the infrastructure provided by the company.

A big disadvantage with cloud-based solutions is the dependency on the company.
It's not easy to change the provider and take the current chatbot with you if it 
is a cloud based chatbot. 
Rasa differs in that point since it can run in any cloud environment inside a docker container.
Every cloud provider offers the option to host docker containers in their cloud.
A major factor is security since the users enter sensitive information in the chatbot communication
and the data is processed in the cloud of the provider.
The cloud provider hence has access to the sensitive information which can be problematic with
bank account information for instance.
Rasa has no such problem since the data is processed inside of the docker container or in a 
local environment.
