Dialogflow can be used by companies for free.
The limits for the free tier are 180 text requests per minute.
With Essential and Plus 600 requests per minute are possible.
Rasa is a free to use open source tool and costs nothing.
There is an enterprise edition with some benefits but the price
is calculated individually.
Watson Assistant offer a free tier with up to 1.000 users per month, 
10.000 messages per month.
A user is a person which interacts with the bot at least once.
The Plus edition costs \$120 for 1.000 users per month with
no message or user limit.
The pricings and editions of the framework are shown in Table \ref{tab:pricing}.
The price of Dialogflow is based on the number of requests,
IBM offers a fixed number of requests and users, and with Rasa the developer has
to take care of the number of users and requests in soft- and hardware.
In the free tier Dialogflow provides the best value because there is message or user limit.
In the priced tier Watson costs \$0.12 per user per month (\$120 for 1.000 users per month).
Dialogflow charges \$0.002 per request.
Watsons cost of \$0.12 per user per month equals 60 requests per user per month with Dialogflow.
