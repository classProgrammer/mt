\subsection*{Portability}
An important factor for software systems is the portability.
Portability is defined in ISO 25010 \cite{iso25010}.
As a measurement criterion, the number of providers that support the technology is defined.
A subfactor is how tied to a provider a technology is.
When it comes to the chatbot cloud services (LUIS, Dialogflow, IBM Watson Assistant)
the provider can't be changed.
All three services run in the cloud of the provider and nowhere else.
The data processing is done in the cloud and can't be done locally or on a company server.
This means that the three cloud services are not portable at all and 
the provider can't be changed.
With Rasa things are different.
It is a local solution which means it can run on a local machine and a company server.
The data processing is also done locally and never goes into the cloud of a provider.
Docker images for Rasa are provided too.
It's possible to run Docker containers in the clouds of all big providers.
This means Rasa can run everywhere where Docker or a Python environment are possible 
and the provider can be changed easily.
Another aspect of portability is the number of devices where the chatbot can be developed
from.
The cloud frameworks are accessible via the internet and can be used 
and developed from every device which has an internet connection and a
browser.
Rasa can only be developed on machines which have access to the 
source files.
It is per default not accessible via the internet.
However, it can be deployed in a cloud environment.
Then it can be used like the cloud services but it 
still can't be developed easily on any device.
The third aspect of portability is the migration from one technology to another.
Rasa offers an import functionality (beta version) which allows The
import of Dialogflow, LUIS, Wit.ai, and IBM Watson chatbots.
In general, all chatbot frameworks use JSON format to store
the training data.
But evert technology saves information differently and it's not 
easy to migrate an existing chatbot to another technology.

% was it possible to implement the design with the technologies?
\subsection*{Implementation of the Design}
like \citet{singhbuilding} said, the best evaluation criteria is if a task can be achieved with a technology or not.
The goal is to implement the dialogs shown in Figure \ref{fig:conversationflow}.
The result of this evaluation is a binary criterion which is either true when the implementation was possible or false
if it wasn't possible.
The prototype implementations in Chapter \ref{chap:proto} shown that the dialogs can be 
implemented with Dialogflow, Watson Assistant, and Rasa.
It is not possible to implement the dialogs with LUIS. 
This was to be expected since LUIS is a NLU service and not a chatbot technology and offers no dialog control.
The Microsoft Bot framework is the chatbot technology which uses LUIS but 
is not considered in this thesis.
The implementation of the dialogs of Figure \ref{fig:conversationflow} is possible with all 
three chatbot technologies.


% project complexity
\subsection*{Project Setup Complexity}
% required tools
As a measurement criterion, the required tools will be used.
To set up Watson Assistant, Dialogflow, and LUIS a web-browser is needed.
Those three technologies require nothing else since the development environment,
files, and data are built into the websites of the technologies.
This means only one tool is required.
For Rasa three approaches are evaluated.
Rasa can be installed locally or with Docker and Rasa-X can be used for development.
Rasa-X provides a web-interface similar to the cloud technologies.
A local setup requires a Python environment and a package manager like pip.
A text editor or IDE is required to edit the files.
This results in a count of at least three.
The second way is a Docker container setup.
For this approach, Docker and a text-editor are required and results in a count of two.
With Rasa-x a web-interface replaces the text-editor but the score remains the same.
This means the could technologies have a score of one and Rasa has a score of two or three
depending on the approach.
% setup time
As second measurement criteria for setup complexity a setup time ranking will be used.
To create a new project from scratch with the cloud technologies only an account is required.
Then a new project can be created instantly.
No tools or additional software needs to be installed to have everything development ready.
For Rasa, the tools and the environment needs to be created.
For the development, either Rasa needs to be installed or the Docker image needs to be pulled.
The setup for Rasa takes more time because the development environment needs to be provided.
This results in the first place for cloud services and the last/second place for Rasa in the
setup time comparison. 

% development complexity
\subsection*{Development Complexity}
% price
\subsection*{Pricing} \label{sec:pricing}
Dialogflow can be used by companies for free.
The limits for the free tier are 180 text requests per minute.
With the Essential and Plus version, 600 requests per minute are possible.
Rasa is a free to use open-source tool and costs nothing.
There is an enterprise edition with some benefits but the price
is calculated individually.
Watson Assistant offers a free tier with up to 1.000 users per month, 
10.000 messages per month.
A user is a person who interacts with the bot at least once.
The Plus edition costs \$120 for 1.000 users per month with
no message or user limit.
The pricings and editions of the framework are shown in Table \ref{tab:pricing}.
The price of Dialogflow is based on the number of requests,
IBM offers a fixed number of requests and users, and with Rasa the developer has
to take care of the number of users and requests in soft- and hardware.
In the free tier, Dialogflow provides the best value because there is no message or user limit.
In the priced tier Watson costs \$0.12 per user per month (\$120 for 1.000 users per month).
Dialogflow charges \$0.002 per request.
Watsons cost of \$0.12 per user per month equals 60 requests per user per month with Dialogflow.

% customization possibilities
\subsection*{Customization Possibilities}
% needed knowledge
\subsection*{Learnability}
The easiest of the chatbot frameworks is Dialogflow.
Compared to Rasa the setup is easy.
The UI is minimalistic and easy to understand.
It's easier to develop a chatbot with Dialogflow than with Watson Assistant or Rasa.
The Watson Assistants UI is intransparent when compared to Dialogflow and a developer 
may need more time to orient.
Rasa requires the most time to develop a chatbot and to get everything ready.

% predefined types/entities
Another measurement criteria for learnability is the number of predefined entities.
If a predefined entity is available for a problem a developer doesn't need to 
invest time in creating an entity or collecting training data. 
Table \ref{tab:predefined_entities} shows the amount of predefined entities 
present for the tested technologies.
Dialogflow provides the most predefined entities, followed by LUIS.
Compared to the two above the other technologies provide a small amount of predefined entities.

\subsection*{Entity Recognition and Extraction}

Entity recognition and extraction is a key feature of chatbots.
For the use-cases of this thesis a date, date-span, and person entity are required.
The entity recognition and extraction tests focus solely on the required entities.
In Table \ref{tab:entity_extraction_recognition} the supported entities are listed alongside the technologies.
Rasa does not offer any entities but the pipeline can be adjusted.
One part of the pipeline is Spacy which offers person and date entities.
Spacy does not convert the date into a standard format.
For this reason, Duckling was added to the pipeline.
Duckling focuses on numeric values, dates, and times and converts dates into a standardized format.
Dialogflow offers the system entities date, date-period, and person.
LUIS offers a person and date-time entity.
The date-time entity can also be a date-span.
Hence, no entities need to be created in LUIS or Dialogflow for the use-cases of this 
thesis.
\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{ c | l | c | c | c | c }
        Framework & Subtype & Person & Date & Date Span & Standardized Output Date \\ \hline \hline
        \multirow{3}{*}{Rasa} & Default & \xmark & \xmark & \xmark & \xmark \\
        & Spacy & \cmark & \cmark & \cmark & \xmark \\ 
        & Duckling & \xmark & \cmark & \cmark & \cmark \\ \hline
        Dialogflow & System & \cmark & \cmark & \cmark & \cmark \\ \hline
        Watson & System & \xmark & \cmark & \xmark & \cmark \\ \hline
        LUIS & System & \cmark & \cmark & \cmark & \cmark \\
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Framework Entity Recognition and Extraction} \label{tab:entity_extraction_recognition}
\end{table} \noindent
Watson Assistant offers the system entity sys-date but no date-span entity.
When Watson recognizes two sys-dates the slots are filled correctly as start and return date
and the result is comparable to a date-span entity.
Dialogflow extracts the date, time, and timezone in the format "2020-06-02T12:00:00+02:00".
Watson and LUIS extract only the date in the format "2020-06-02".
Duckling extracts dates (time entity) in the format "2020-06-07T00:00:00.000-07:00".
The second date of date spans is always set to one day after the recognized day in Duckling.
This means that the second dates of Duckling differ from the dates of the other technologies
shown in Table \ref{tab:date_span_entity_extraction_recognition} in the "Extracted Value" column.
The column "Extracted Value" of Tables \ref{tab:date_entity_extraction_recognition},
\ref{tab:date_entity_extraction_recognition2},
and \ref{tab:date_span_entity_extraction_recognition},
\ref{tab:date_span_entity_extraction_recognition2} show that Spacy doesn't 
convert the dates into standard format.
The date and date-span tests focus on different date inputs.
It is to be expected that a recognized date format works for 
all instances of the format.
If Monday is recognized correctly the other weekdays will work too. 

The person entity has been added to Watson Assistant with custom training data.
The expectation is that the person entity of Watson Assistant performs worst because 
it's no system entity and is built with a low amount of training data.
The results of the date recognition and extraction are listed in Table \ref{tab:date_entity_extraction_recognition}
and \ref{tab:date_entity_extraction_recognition2}.
The expectation of the results is listed as true positive(TP) when the date should be recognized and extracted or as true negative(TN)
when the entity shouldn't be recognized and extracted.
The test result shows that the date entity of Dialogflow worked best with just one error
followed closely by Duckling with two errors.
Spacy performed worst with five errors in ten tests followed by Watson Assistant with four errors out of ten.
No technology worked correctly on test case eight of Table \ref{tab:date_entity_extraction_recognition}.
This is true for the english language selection.
When German is selected as a language the performance on dates separated by
"." increases.
It also shows that weekdays and tomorrow work with all technologies.
The extracted value column shows that Spacy recognizes many date inputs correctly but doesn't convert them.

    \caption{Entity Recognition Result Evaluation} \label{tab:entity_extraction_eval}
\end{table} \noindent
The detailed result of the entity recognition comparison is shown in Table \ref{tab:entity_extraction_eval}.
The column name p stands for precision and r for recall.
Date sum shows the framework result based on the date and date-span recognition
without the person entity for the comparison with Duckling which has no person entity.
The last row of Table \ref{tab:entity_extraction_eval} shows the result for the combination 
of Duckling for dates and date-spans and Spacy for persons.
This makes the comparison of Rasa with the other technologies possible.
The true negatives (TN) are not part of the f-score calculation.
Table \ref{tab:entity_extraction_eval} shows that the technology with the 
best f-score across all tests (0.914) is Dialogflow followed by 
a combination of Duckling for dates and date-spans and Spacy  
for persons is used.
Rasa can use Duckling and Spacy and reaches the second highest f-score.
The best f-score (0.929) for the combination of dates and date-spans was achieved  
by Dialogflow.
Dialogflow has the best date entity (f-score of 0.94) when the date-time entity is used 
instead of the date-period entity.
The date-period entity of Dialogflow reached a low f-score of 0.5 and is not recommended for further use. 
Duckling, Watson, and Dialogflow were on an equal level when only date-spans are considered. 
All three reached an f-score of 0.909.
Dialogflow also has the best f-score for the person entity.
Watsons person entity performed worst as expected.
With more training data the performance of Watsons custom person 
entity can be increased.
In test case two of Table \ref{tab:date_span_entity_extraction_recognition} Spacy 
recognized two separate dates instead of a date-span.
This is counted as a failure because in the application there is only one date slot present
and the information can't be processed correctly.
In test case one Dialogflows date-period entity and Luis convert Monday to a date in the past.
This is now what is needed for the use-cases since it should be the next matching 
weekday and not the last.
Test case two gives a hint that the next occurring weekday is the correct one.
The result is not influenced and Dialogflows date-period entity and LUIS still take the wrong day.
The functionality was retested on another day.
LUIS still failed to extract the correct date but Dialogflow 
managed to do so.
In the test result it will be counted as a failure of Dialogflows date-period entity
since it doesn't deliver reliable results.

% precision of intent recognition
\subsection*{Intent Recognition}
The main task of a chatbot is to find the intent best matching the user input.
The training utterances for the sickness intent are listed Tabel \ref{tab:sickness_utterances}
in the Appendix.
The phrases for the vacation intent can be found in Table \ref{tab:vacation_utterances}.
As an evaluation criterion, multiple parameters are used.
The confidence score represents how well the input can be classified.
Building upon the entity extraction the correct extraction of the entities in combined inputs is tested. 
A combined example is training phrase five of Table \ref{tab:sickness_utterances} 
where the entities person and date are built into the training sentence.
Furthermore, the correctly identified intents are used to calculate the f-score 
like it was done for the entities.
For the intent recognition task, only date and date-spans are used which
were recognized by all relevant frameworks to ensure unbiased tests.
Spacy has no relevance for the application in terms of date and date-span
extraction and is not considered for dates in the intent recognition tests.
% tests
The detailed test are listed in Table \ref{tab:sickness_intent_classification} and 
Table \ref{tab:vacation_intent_classification}.
The test evaluation is shown in Table \ref{tab:intent_classification_result}.
The tests show that LUIS has the lowest confidence scores on average.
Dialogflow always scores above 50\% confidence and often reaches 100\%.
The scores of Watson Assistant are similar to Dialogflow with the difference 
that the confidence score was below 50\% at times.
The confidence scores of Rasa are lower than the ones of Dialogflow and Watson on 
average and higher than with LUIS, shown in 
Table \ref{tab:intent_classification_result}.
Dialogflow and Watson managed to classify all intents correctly.
The entity extraction of Dialogflow failed in test case 4 of 
Table \ref{tab:sickness_intent_classification} since "myself" has been extracted as a person.
This means that the person slot was set incorrectly.
LUIS didn't extract the person in test sentence six of 
Table \ref{tab:sickness_intent_classification}.
The test sentences get more complex the higher the number.
Dialogflow and Watson were able to correctly classify all test sentences
whereas Rasa and LUIS failed to correctly classify the more complex sentences.
This leads to the conclusion that Watson and Dialogflow work better with 
complex sentences when a small amount of training data is used.
% F-score
The result in Table \ref{tab:intent_classification_result} shows that 
Dialogflow and Watson reach a perfect f-score of 1.0.
Rasa was able to reach a much higher f-score on the vacation use-case than 
on the sickness use-case.
This implies that the vacation test sentences were better classified by the system than
the sickness related sentences. 
LUIS reached the lowest f-score on the vacation use-case and only 
classified one vacation test sentence correctly.
LUIS and Rasa reached the same f-score on the sickness test sentences.
The average confidence was highest with Dialogflow followed 
closely by Watson Assistant.
Compared to Dialogflow and Watson Assistant the average confidence
score of Rasa is a lot lower.
LUIS reached the lowest average confidence score of all four technologies.

The same experiment is also interesting with German as language since the potential 
users are from a German speaking country.
The training data is listed in the Appendix in Table \ref{tab:sickness_utterances_de} and 
Table \ref{tab:vacation_utterances_de}.
The translates test sentences are listed in Table \ref{tab:sickness_intent_classification_de} 
and Table \ref{tab:vacation_intent_classification_de} with a boolean value which indicates if the 
correct intent was identified, a boolean that indicates if the entities were extracted correctly,
and the confidence score for each test case.
The finalized result is listed in \ref{tab:intent_classification_result_de} and shows 
that the average confidence score for the German test sentences is a higher than 
for the English test sentences for each technology individually.
The f-score also increased significantly which indicates that the German test sentences are 
recognized better than the English test sentences.
The ranking of the Technologies is also different from before since three technologies 
achieved perfect f-scores the ranking is based on the average confidence.
The highest confidence was achieved by Watson.
The second place goes to LUIS contrairy to the 
English test sentences where LUIS performed worst.
LUIS was able to increas the average confidence from about 30\% on the English tests 
to about 85\% on the German tests.
Dialogflow only reaches the third place.
The intent recognition are top notch for all technologies and all can be recommended from that 
point of view.
The results in Table \ref{tab:sickness_intent_classification_de} and \ref{tab:vacation_intent_classification_de} 
show that the entity extraction results drop in the German setup with all technologies except LUIS.
Dialogflow has problems to extract the person entity correctly in German sentences although German 
has been selected in the settings. 
The system entity date-time of Dialogflow is unable to handle German date formats although 
the dialog language is set to German.
Watson doesn't offer entity annotation in training sentences when German is selected as language.
This means that Watson is only recommended for an English bot until the annotation of entities in 
training phrases is enabled for other languages.
LUIS offers a person entity when English is selected but not for the German language.
The date-time entity of LUIS is able to handle German date formats. 
This means that LUIS is the only technology which achieved a satidfying result in the entity extraction category.
All in all, the intent recognition result is very good for the German language tests but the entity extraction 
often fails.

\subsection*{Framework Concepts}
The user interfaces of the cloud frameworks are similar.
The interfaces are shown in Figure \ref{fig:dialogflow_interface},
\ref{fig:watson_interface}, and \ref{fig:luis_interface}.
All three offer intents and entities.
They are all structured similarly with the menu to the left.
The information for the bots is always entered as text.
Intents are always built with training phrases.
All offer prebuilt system entities.
Dialogflow has the most prebuilt entities, followed by LUIS,
then comes Rasa, and Watson Assistant offers the fewest entities.
For the sickness and vacation use-case the entities of 
Dialogflow suit best because no entity has to be defined by 
the developer. 
Watson offers a person system entity in English but the entity
is marked as deprecated.
It offers a date entity but no date span entity.
This means with Watson Assistant two entities have to be 
modeled for the use-cases.
LUIS offers a date-time entity which can be used for dates and 
date spans but it's not working as reliable as the one from 
Dialogflow.
It did not identify "22-06 to 30-06" correctly
which is no problem for Dialogflow.
